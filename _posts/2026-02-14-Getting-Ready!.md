It's the morning of Saturday before the penultimate Saturday before we go...or 2 weeks to go!

**TWO WEEKS!**

There's lots to do. We've made a list. There's also so little time left to do things. Mark has just 10 days left of his first working life, so will be visiting the office for more days than usual, whilst Bianca is left to sort most things out... as usual!

Today is the first for what seems like forever that we have awoken to blue skies and no rain; time to drink my tea, get out of bed, and get a wiggle on!
