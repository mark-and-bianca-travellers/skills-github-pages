This is an example of a post in our blog.
It has been created during the build of this blog, to illustrate the creation process.
As we hope / will be posting on our travels, with minimal equipment, we've built this using GitHub Pages using an iPad and an iPhone.

So far, so good!

To allow notifications of our posts, we've also added an [RSS feed](https://mark-and-bianca-travellers.github.io/skills-github-pages/feed.xml).  Add this link to your reader, and turn-on notifications for it.

It's been raining.  A lot!
