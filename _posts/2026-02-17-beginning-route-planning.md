Having grabbed two bargain flights in and out of Nassau, three weeks apart, we now need to plan where, precisely, we are going!

Nassau is on New Providence island, where we arrive and will stay for 4 nights before moving on to George Town on Exuma. This should be a short flight of a couple of hours in a tiny plane. We'll be in and around George Town for another 4 nights.

From Exuma we'll take a boat for the short hop to Long Island.

This is the plan, so far. Next we need to figure whether we go further south, before heading north to Cat Island, or we go to Cat Island straightaway. Either which way, we need to make our way back to Nassau for our flight home.
