By some miracle, we’ve managed to get the majority of our packing done.  As in, everything we think we need is stowed in two (relatively small) bags, and the zips have been closed. That’s not to say that they won’t be opened again, and again, before we finally set off, but we think we’re done. We’re very pleased with ourselves!
